Hello!

This repository isn't very interesting as a website, but sure is good practice for learning command line!

Try to replicate this file structure, it's files, _and_ their content entirely from the command line.  You can either do this directly on your computer, or online in [smith-unna's command line tutorial](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=o220tgni8i) environment. (beware! The smith-unna site is incredibly helpful but it won't save your changes when you refresh)
