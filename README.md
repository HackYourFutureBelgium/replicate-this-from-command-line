Hello!

This repository isn't very interesting as a website, but sure is good practice for learning command line!

Try to replicate this file structure, it's files, _and_ their content entirely from the command line.  

> if you have any ideas how to make this directory structure more learningful to replicate, send us a pull request with the new files/folders added!
